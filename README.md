# NumPy Functions Explorer with Streamlit

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive web application that allows users to explore and understand various NumPy functions through a user-friendly interface. This tool provides detailed descriptions, syntaxes, and example outputs for a comprehensive set of NumPy functions, facilitating learning and practical application for data scientists and enthusiasts.

## What I Have Done
- Developed a Streamlit application to showcase and explain a wide range of NumPy functions.
- Implemented interactive features that let users select and view details about each NumPy function.
- Included examples and practical outputs for functions such as np.flatten, np.where, np.sum, np.linalg.inv, and more.
- Added functionalities to display visual outputs for functions like np.imshow.
  
## Requirements
- Python: Programming language used for development.
- Streamlit: Framework for creating the web application.
- NumPy: Library for numerical operations and array handling.
- Matplotlib (for np.imshow): Library for plotting and visualizing images.
  
## Libraries
- Streamlit: Provides the framework for creating the interactive web application.
- NumPy: Core library for numerical operations and handling arrays.
- Matplotlib: Used for displaying images and plots (e.g., np.imshow).
